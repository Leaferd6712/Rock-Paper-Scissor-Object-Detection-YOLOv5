# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Object Detection using YOLOv5 | Pretrained Model Demo

This repository contains a **real-time Rock Paper Scissors hand gesture detection system** using **YOLOv5** and Computer Vision.

The project demonstrates how to **run a pretrained YOLOv5 model** to detect Rock, Paper, and Scissors using your **webcam**.
No training is required as the model is already trained and ready to use.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8 or newer
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code) — can be installed from Microsoft Store
* A webcam

---

## 🐍 Installing Python (IMPORTANT)

If you do not already have Python installed:

1. Go to this website:
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

2. Click:
   Windows installer (64-bit)

3. Open the downloaded installer.

4. On the first installer screen, MAKE SURE you:

   * Tick the box: Add Python to PATH

5. Then click:

   * Install Now

6. After it finishes installing, **close any open PowerShell or Terminal windows**.

7. Open PowerShell again:

   * Press Windows Key + X
   * Click Terminal or PowerShell

8. Check that Python works:

```
python --version
```

## 🚀 FULL SETUP GUIDE (STEP BY STEP)

### 🔹 Step 1 — Download the Repository

1. Go to this page in your browser:
   [https://github.com/Leaferd6712/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5](https://github.com/Leaferd6712/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5)

2. Click the green button **Code → Download ZIP**

3. Extract that folder and keep it in the Downloads

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Open PowerShell and Go to the Project Folder

On Windows:

* Press Windows Key + X
* Click Terminal or PowerShell

Now enter this (IMPORTANT: change the username part if your Windows username is different):

```
cd "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Downloads\Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5-master\Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5-master"
```

(Only the "YOURUSERNAME" part may need to be changed to your own username, otherwise the full path should work if it is kept in the downloads section of your files)

---

### 🔹 Step 3 — Create a Virtual Environment (Only Once)

Make sure you are inside the project folder:

```
python -m venv yolovenv
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4 — Activate the Virtual Environment

In PowerShell:

```
.\yolovenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If successful, you should see:

```
(yolovenv)
```

If PowerShell blocks it, run:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Then try again:

```
.\yolovenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5 — Install Dependencies (IMPORTANT)

Make sure you see:

(yolovenv)

First, upgrade pip inside the virtual environment:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6 — Run the Rock Paper Scissors Detector

```
python detect.py --weights runs/train/third_run/weights/best.pt --source 0 --img-size 640 --conf-thres 0.25 --device 0
```

---

## 💡 Understanding Command Options

Here’s what the main options mean:

* `--conf-thres 0.25`
  Controls how confident the model must be before showing a detection.

  * 0.10 → more detections but more errors
  * 0.25 → good balance (default)
  * 0.50 → fewer detections but more accurate

* `--device 0`
  Selects which hardware to use:

  * `0` → first GPU (if available)
  * `cpu` → force CPU
  * If no GPU is available, YOLO automatically uses CPU

---

## 🎯 What This Does

* Opens your webcam
* Loads the trained YOLOv5 model
* Detects Rock, Paper, Scissors in real time

---

## 🔁 How to Run It Again Later

Go to the project folder (remember to change the username part if needed):

```
cd "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Downloads\Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5-master\Rock-Paper-Scissor-Object-Detection-YOLOv5-master"
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
.\yolovenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Run the detector:

```
python detect.py --weights runs/train/third_run/weights/best.pt --source 0 --img-size 640 --conf-thres 0.25 --device 0
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

* Make sure your webcam is not being used by another app
* Press Q to quit the detection window
